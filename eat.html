<p>On Christmas Day 1982, the house that became home to the Woodstock Inn opened, which then boasted four guest rooms, a 25-seat restaurant and a room for the owners up in the attic.
In the 30 years since that day, the Woodstock Inn has become the social center for locals and a home-away-from-home for visitors to return to year after year. They are drawn
to the fine food, warm hospitality and even a sense of belonging each time they come back to visit, making true the slogan, ‘Great Taste from a Special Place.’ The Inn is known for its handcrafted brews, burgers, steaks, pizzas, and more. </p>
