  <h1>About Me</h1></br>
  <p>My name is Lindsay Dumont and I am a sophomore at North Smithfield High School. I love reading,
    writing, and listening to music. I created this webpage because New Hampshire is one of my favorite places
    to visit; I go every year with my family. I hope this webpage is helpful in planning a visit to New Hampshire so
    that everyone has the chance to see such a beautiful state.</p>
